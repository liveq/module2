			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>
		Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. 
Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations.
